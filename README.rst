Vagrant and VirtualBox DevStack Environment for Routed Networks
===============================================================

The Vagrant file and shell scripts in this repository deploy OpenStack in a
five nodes configuration  using DevStack. The aim is to support development
and testing of Neutron's Routed Networks functionality.

The deployed nodes are:

#. An OpenStack control plane, network node and compute node, named
   ``allinone``, containing the following OpenStack services:

   * Identity.
   * Image. 
   * Compute, including control plane and hypervisor.
   * Networking, including control plane, L2 agent and L3 agent in legacy mode
     without high availabiltiy.
   * Block Storage.

#. Three compute nodes, named ``compute1``, ``compute2`` and ``compute3``,
   containing Compute hypervisors and Networking L2 agents. ``compute2`` is
   also configured as a network node.

#. One ip router, named ``iprouter``, to route traffic between segments of
   routed networks.

During deployment, Vagrant creates the following VirtualBox networks:

#. Vagrant management network for deployment and nodes access to external
   networks such as the Internet. Becomes ``eth0`` network interface in all
   nodes.
#. Management network for the OpenStack control plane and Networking Service
   overlay networks (VXLAN). Becomes the ``eth1`` network interface in all
   nodes.
#. Physical network ``physnet1`` for VLAN type networks / segments. Becomes the
   ``eth2`` network interface in nodes ``allinone``, ``compute1`` and
   ``iprouter``.
#. Physical network ``physnet2`` for VLAN type networks / segments. Becomes the
   ``eth3`` network interface in nodes ``compute2``, ``compute3`` and
   ``iprouter``.

   .. note::
      The ``eth3`` network interface is not configured in nodes ``allinone``
      and ``compute1``. Conversely, the ``eth2`` network interface is not
      configured in nodes ``compute2`` and ``compute3``.

   .. note::
      The way physical networks ``physnet1`` and ``physnet2`` are configured
      enable the simulation of two "compute racks", the first one formed by
      nodes ``allinone`` and ``compute1`` and the second formed by nodes
      ``compute2`` and ``compute3``. Traffic is routed between these "compute
      racks" by node ``iprouter``.

DevStack installation directory
-------------------------------

All the services enabled in DevStack are installed in ``/opt/stack``. The
``Nova`` and ``Neutron`` repositories are configured as Vagrant ``synced
folders`` with the following mapping:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 30

   * - Host machines
     - Nodes
   * - ~/nova
     - /opt/stack/nova
   * - ~/neutron
     - /opt/stack/neutron

This mapping enables the user to do all the Nova and Neutron development
activities with his / her tools of choice in the host machine, with all the
changes being reflected immediately in the nodes.

.. note::
   ``vim`` is configured in all nodes to support Python development. Besides
   having a proper ``.vimrc`` file for the ``vagrant`` account, the following
   ``vim`` plug-ins are installed and enabled:

   * `Syntastic <https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic.git>`_ for syntax
     checking, configured with
     `Flake8 <https://flake8.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`_ for Python and pep8.
   * `SimpyFold <https://github.com/tmhedberg/SimpylFold>`_ for Python code
     folding.
   * `delimiMate <https://github.com/Raimondi/delimitMate>`_ for automatic
     closing of quotes, parenthesis, brackets, etc.

Requirements
------------

The default configuration requires approximately 11 GB of RAM. The amount of
resources for each node can be changed in the
``provisioning/virtualbox.conf.yml`` file.

Deployment
----------

#. Install `VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads>`_,
   `Vagrant <https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html>`_ and
   `Packer <https://www.packer.io/docs/install/index.html>`_.

#. To be able to create Ubuntu 16.04 boxes for Vagrant with enough disk space
   to support devstack, clone this repository into your home directory and
   change to it::

     $ git clone https://github.com/chef/bento
     $ cd bento

#. Create a fresh Ubuntu 16.04 box and load it to Vagrant. It is recommended
   to perform this step peridiocally so devstack is always built on an up to
   date operating system. The commands to do this are::

     $ packer build -only=virtualbox-iso ubuntu-16.04-amd64.json
     $ vagrant box add builds/ubuntu-16.04.virtualbox.box --name miguel/ubuntu-16.04 --force

     The value provided to the --name option in the second command can be
     changed to any valid string.

#. Clone the ``nova`` and ``neutron`` repositories into your home directory::

     $ git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack/nova.git
     $ git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack/neutron.git

#. Clone this repository into your home directory and change to it::

     $ git clone https://github.com/miguellavalle/routednetworksvagrant
     $ cd routednetworksvagrant

#. Install plug-ins for Vagrant::

     $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-cachier
     $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest

#. Update in ``provisioning/virtualbox.conf.yml`` the name of the box to be
   used by Vagrant, as specified in previous step::

     box: "miguel/ubuntu-16.04"

#. If necessary, adjust any configuration in the
   ``provisioning/virtualbox.conf.yml`` file.

#. Launch Vagrant and grab some coffee::

     $ vagrant up

#. After the process completes, you can use the ``vagrant status`` command
   to determine the nodes status::

     $ vagrant status
     Current machine states:

     allinone              running (virtualbox)
     compute1              running (virtualbox)
     compute2              running (virtualbox)
     compute3              running (virtualbox)
     iprouter              running (virtualbox)

#. You can access the nodes using the following commands::

     $ vagrant ssh allinone
     $ vagrant ssh compute1
     $ vagrant ssh compute2
     $ vagrant ssh compute3
     $ vagrant ssh iprouter

#. Access OpenStack services via command-line tools on the ``allinone``
   node or via the dashboard from the host by pointing a web browser at the
   IP address of the ``allinone`` node.

   .. note::
   By default, OpenStack includes two accounts: ``admin`` and ``demo``, both
   using password ``devstack``. Keystone has been configured to issue token
   with a life of 1 year.

#. You can save the state of the entire configuration::
     
     $ vagrant suspend

#. Periodically, it will be necessary to re-build devstack from scratch. When
   that happens, you can destroy the configuration and perform the steps in
   this guide again::

     $ vagrant destroy
